<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> short play needs rather a long introduction. It
has had the bad fortune to become a literary problem,
and almost all its few readers are so much occupied with
the question whether it can be the work of Euripides&mdash;and
if not his, whose?&mdash;that they seldom allow
themselves to take it on its merits as a stirring and adventurous
piece, not particularly profound or subtle,
but always full of movement and life and possessing
at least one or two scenes of great and penetrating
beauty.</p>

<p>The outlines of the <i>Rhesus</i> Question are these.&mdash;The
<i>Rhesus</i> appears in the MSS. of Euripides; we
know from the Athenian Didascaliae, or Records of
Performances, that Euripides wrote a play of the
name; some passages in it are quoted by early
Alexandrian writers as from "the <i>Rhesus</i> of Euripides;"
no passage is quoted under any other name.
This seems about as strong as external evidence
need be. Yet the ancient introduction to the play
mentions that "some think the play spurious," and
expresses the odd opinion that "it suggests rather the
Sophoclean style." Further, it tells us that, besides
the present opening scene, there were extant two
different prologues, one of which was "quite prosy and
perhaps concocted by the actors." This seems to show
that the Alexandrian scholars who tried for the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
time to collect the complete works of Euripides, some
two centuries after his death, found this play current
as "Euripides' <i>Rhesus</i>," but that it was credited with
three different openings and that its style was felt to
be somehow peculiar.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of style is incontestable. It does
not to our judgment suggest Sophocles. It suggests
a young man imitating Aeschylus, and it has a great
number of Euripidean expressions. Hermann, who
collected what he took to be "imitations" of early
poets in the <i>Rhesus</i>, noted only 25 of Sophocles,
38 of Aeschylus, and 84 of Euripides.</p>

<p>Is it, then, the work of a somewhat imitative fourth-century
poet, naturally influenced by his great forerunners?
Hardly: because, with a few exceptions,
the verse and diction of the <i>Rhesus</i>, are markedly early
in character, the verse severe and smooth, the diction
direct and rather grandiose, the choral lyrics strictly
relevant. In Euripides' later years Drama was moving
rapidly away from all these things and, as far as we
can judge, continued so moving after his death. If
the <i>Rhesus</i> is a post-classical play it can hardly be
honest fourth-century work: it must be deliberately
archaistic, a product of the Alexandrian spirit if not
actually of the Alexandrian age. This is what
Hermann believed. But unfortunately it is not a
bit more like our fragments of Alexandrian tragedy
than it is like the <i>Medea</i>; and, further, if it is an
Alexandrian pseudo-classic tragedy, how did it succeed
in deceiving the Alexandrian critics, detectives specially
trained for this kind of work?</p>

<hr style="width: 5%;" />

<p>Let us try quite a different hypothesis, and begin by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
accepting the external evidence as true. The famous
critic, Crates, of the second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, happens to
mention&mdash;in excuse of what he took to be a slip in the
poet's astronomy&mdash;that the <i>Rhesus</i> of Euripides was
a youthful work. Now the earliest dated tragedy of
Euripides that we possess is the <i>Alcestis</i>, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 438,
written when he was about forty-six. His style
may well have been considerably different fifteen or
twenty years earlier, and must certainly have been
much under the influence of Aeschylus. So far, so
good. Then what of the other difficulties, the three
different opening scenes and the few passages of late
phrasing or technique? One obvious explanation
suits both. The three different openings pretty
clearly imply that the play was reproduced more than
once after the poet's death and adapted by the producer
for each occasion. This happened to many plays of
Euripides, and in one case we even know the name of
the producer; he was Euripides the Younger, son
of the poet. Among other things we have reason to
believe that he wrote some parts of the <i>Iphigenia in
Aulis</i>. And in this connexion we can hardly help
noticing that the <i>Iphigenia in Aulis</i>, like the <i>Rhesus</i>
and like no other Greek tragedy, has two alternative
openings, one a dull prologue and one a lyrical scene
in anapaests under the stars. The general style of the
two plays is utterly different; the <i>Iphigenia</i> is most
typically late Euripidean; but one would not be surprised
to learn that they had both passed at some time
through the same revising hand.</p>

<p>This hypothesis seems to work well. But one
difficulty remains.</p>

<p>We have so far gone on the supposition that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>Euripides at twenty-five or thirty perhaps wrote very
differently from Euripides at forty-six, and that the
manner we call Euripidean is only the manner of
his later life. There is nothing improbable in this
suggestion, but have we any evidence? Yes, a very
little, and unfortunately it does not say what we
want. We have some fragments&mdash;twenty lines
altogether&mdash;preserved from the <i>Peliades</i>, with which
Euripides won his first victory in the year 455,
seventeen years before the <i>Alcestis</i>, and as far as they
go they are just in his ordinary manner&mdash;a good deal
more so, in fact, than much of the <i>Alcestis</i> is. Let us
face this difficulty.</p>

<p>The ordinary style of Euripides is full, flexible,
lucid, antithetic, studiously simple in vocabulary and
charged with philosophic reflection. If we look in
his extant remains for any trace of a style, like that
of the <i>Rhesus</i>, which is comparatively terse, rich,
romantic, not shrinking from rare words and strong
colour and generally untinged by philosophy, we shall
find the nearest approach to it in the <i>Cyclops</i>. Next
to the <i>Cyclops</i> I am not sure what play would come,
but the <i>Alcestis</i> would not be far off. It has
especially several Epic forms which cannot be
paralleled in tragedy. Now the conjunction of
these two plays with the <i>Rhesus</i> is significant. The
three seem to be three earliest of the extant plays;
they are also&mdash;if we count the <i>Heraclidae</i> as mutilated&mdash;the
three shortest. But, what is more important,
the <i>Cyclops</i> is not a tragedy but a satyr-play, and
the <i>Alcestis</i> is a tragedy of a special sort, written to
take the place of a satyr-play. It is a tragedy with
some half grotesque figures and a fantastic atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>This is no place for a close analysis of the diction
of the various works of Euripides; but taking one
rough test, just for what it is worth, we may try to
count the number of words in each play which are
not found elsewhere in Euripides. The <i>Medea</i>, a
central sort of play, has in its 1419 lines 103 such
words. The <i>Alcestis</i>, with 1163 lines, has 122; the
<i>Rhesus</i>, with less than 1000 lines, has 177; the <i>Cyclops</i>,
with only 701 lines, has actually 220. This calculation
is doubtless slightly inexact: in any case it is worth
very little until it is carefully analysed. But on the
whole it accords with my general impression that the
<i>Rhesus</i> in its variation from the Euripidean norm goes
further than the <i>Alcestis</i>, and not so far as the <i>Cyclops</i>,
and goes in very much the same direction. I feel in
the <i>Rhesus</i> a good deal of that curious atmosphere, not
exactly comic, but wild and extravagant, which the
Greeks felt to be suited to the Satyr horde; the
atmosphere normally breathed by the one-eyed Giant
of the cavern on volcanic Aetna, or the drunken and
garlanded Heracles who wrestles with Death and
cracks his ribs for him at midnight among the tombs.
The whole scene and setting of the <i>Rhesus</i>; the
man-wolf crawling away into the darkness and his two
enemies presently crawling in out of the same darkness
with his bloody spoils; the divine Thracian king
with his round targe that shines by night and his
horses whiter than the snow; the panic of the watch,
the vaunting of the doomed chieftain, the goddess
disguised as another goddess, the thrilling half-farcical
scene where the spy Odysseus is actually caught and
befools his captors: these things are not of course
comic, like some incidents in the <i>Cyclops</i>. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>belong to tragedy; but they are near the outside
limit of the tragic convention, and would perhaps be
most at home in a pro-satyric tragedy like the <i>Alcestis</i>.</p>

<p>In the upshot I see no adequate reason for rejecting
the external evidence which makes this play a work of
Euripides, if we suppose it to be an early pro-satyric
play which was produced again after the poet's death
by Euripides the Younger or some contemporary.
Most scholars, however, prefer to think it simply an
archaistic work of the fourth century.</p>

<p>On this theory the Alexandrians when looking for
the <i>Rhesus</i> of Euripides found an anonymous play
called <i>Rhesus</i> and accepted it for what it was worth.
The Prologues mentioned in the argument would
perhaps belong to other plays of the same name;
one, no doubt, to the real play of Euripides. The
rich and severe style may, for all we know&mdash;for
direct evidence fails us&mdash;be the natural mark of
some reactionary archaistic school about the time
of Plato or Aristotle. The same date might well
be indicated by the great interest our play takes
in the Iliad, and by its almost "Alexandrian" use
of the gods as ornamental machinery. I cannot call
such a theory improbable; but it really amounts
to rejecting the external evidence in order to place
the <i>Rhesus</i> in a period of tragic style of which we
happen to know nothing. It is certainly not confirmed
by the scanty fragments we possess of Theodectes
or Chairemon.</p>

<p>And, if one is to venture into more speculative
and subjective arguments, I find it rather hard to
think of any lyric poet except Euripides who could
have written the Adrasteia chorus or the lines about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>the Nightingale in the Watchers' Song; of any playwright
except Euripides who would have ended a
play of gallant martial adventure with the vision of
a solitary mother clasping her dead son. There are
many other passages, too, like the mysterious sobbing
in the dark that heralds the entry of the wounded
Thracian, and the final passing out of the army to its
certain defeat, which seem to me more like undeveloped
genius than common imitative mediocrity.
If a nameless fourth-century poet wrote this play,
I think we should have heard more of him.</p>

<hr style="width: 5%;" />

<p>The story of the play is taken straight from the
Doloneia, an Epic rhapsody which now takes its place
as the Tenth Book of the Iliad, but was very likely
independent in the time of Euripides (<i>Rise of the
Greek Epic</i>, p. 313 f.). The play seems in one or
two points to follow a more archaic model than
the version in our Homer. (See notes on l. 150
and l. 175.)</p>

<p>In Rhesus himself&mdash;the name is said to be the
Thracian form of <i>rex</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;we seem to have the traditional
divine king of the Thracian tribes about Pangaion,
seen through the eyes of Greek romance.
He is the son of the greatest of Rivers and the Muse
of the Mountain: she is simply "The Muse," otherwise
nameless, and we are lost if we try to bind
her down to the identity of any Greek goddess. Like
many Thracian heroes Rhesus has a dash of the Sun-god
in him, the burning targe, the white horses
and the splendour. Like them he is a boaster and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>a deep drinker, a child of battle and of song. Like
other divine kings he dies in his youth and strength,
and keeps watch over his people from some "feasting
presence, full of light," where he lies among
the buried silver-veins of Pangaion. If the uttermost
need comes, doubtless he will wake again.
When the Athenians began making their dangerous
settlements on the coast of Thrace&mdash;ten thousand
settlers were massacred by Rhesus's people about
465 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>: Amphipolis not fully established till 437&mdash;they
found the legend of Rhesus in the air, and
eventually they thought it prudent to send for his
hallowed bones from the Troad, where they were
supposed to be buried, and give them a tomb in
the Athenian colony. Possibly that pacified him.
And his legend in the mouth of the poets seemed
perhaps like the story of his own mountaineers,
multitudes of strong men, stormy and chivalrous,
terrible in onset, who somehow in the end melted
away before the skill and persistent courage of a
civilised Greek city.</p>

I like that beacon-burning in the night.
    O Zeus above, who checked my conquering way,
Who baulked the hungry lion of his prey
Or ever I could sweep my country clear
Of these despoilers, dost thou hate my spear?
Had but the sun's bright arrows failed me not,
I ne'er had rested till the ships were hot
With fire, and through the tents upon the plain
This bloody hand had passed and passed again!
Myself, I longed to try the battle-cast
By night, and use God's vantage to the last,
But sage and prophet, learned in the way
Of seercraft, bade me wait for dawn of day,
And then&mdash;leave no Greek living in the land.
They wait not, they, for what my prophets planned
So sagely. In the dark a runaway
Beats a pursuer.
                        Through our whole array
Send runners! Bid them shake off sleep and wait
Ready with shield and spear. 'Tis not too late
To catch them as they climb on board, and slash
Their crouching shoulders till the gangways splash
With blood, or teach them, fettered leg and arm,
To dig the stiff clods of some Trojan farm.

One check there, and all hope of good return
Is gone. How can our men, returning, learn
The tricks of the palisade? The chariots how
Keep to the bridges on the trenches' brow,
Save with jammed wheels and broken axles? Aye,
And say thou conquer: other wars yet lie
Before thee. Peleus' son, for all his ire,
Will never let thee touch the ships with fire
Or pounce on his Greek lambs. The man will bide
No wrong and standeth on a tower of pride.
    Nay, brother, let the army, head on shield,
Sleep off its long day's labour in the field:
Then, send a spy; find someone who will dare
Creep to yon Argive camp. Then, if 'tis clear
They mean flight, on and smite them as they fly.
Else, if the beacons hide some strategy,
The spy will read it out, and we can call
A council.&mdash;Thus speak I, my general.

'Tis hard to land at night, with such a press

And wolfish thickets thus to hear him break.
A great and rushing noise those Thracians make,
Marching. We, all astonied, ran to drive
Our sheep to the upmost heights. 'Twas some Argive,
We thought, who came to sweep the mountain clear
And waste thy folds; till suddenly our ear
Caught at their speech, and knew 'twas nothing Greek.
Then all our terror fled. I ran to seek
Some scout or pioneer who led the van
And called in Thracian: "Ho, what child of man
Doth lead you? From what nation do ye bring
This host with aid to Ilion and her king?"
    He told me what I sought, and there I stood
Watching; and saw one gleaming like a God,
Tall in the darkness on a Thracian car.
A plate of red gold mated, like a bar,
His coursers' necks, white, white as fallen snow.
A carven targe, with golden shapes aglow,
Hung o'er his back. Before each courser's head
A Gorgon, to the frontlet riveted,
With bells set round&mdash;like stories that they tell
Of Pallas' shield&mdash;made music terrible.
The numbers of that host no pen could write
Nor reckon; 'tis a multitudinous sight,
Long lines of horsemen, lines of targeteers,
Archers abundant; and behind them veers
A wavering horde, light-armed, in Thracian weed.
    A friend is come to Ilion in her need
'Gainst whom no Argive, let him fly or stand,
Shall aught avail nor 'scape his conquering hand.

</span>    Long, long ago thou shouldst have borne thy part
In Ilion's labours, not have left us here,
For all thy help, to sink beneath the spear.
Why didst thou&mdash;not for lack of need made plain!&mdash;
Not come, not send, not think of us again?
What grave ambassadors prayed not before
Thy throne, what herald knelt not at thy door?
What pride of gifts did Troy not send to thee?
And thou, a lord of Barbary even as we,
Thou, brother of our blood, like one at sup
Who quaffs his fill and flings away the cup,
Hast flung to the Greeks my city! Yet, long since,
'Twas I that found thee but a little prince
And made thee mighty, I and this right hand;
When round Pangaion and the Pai&ocirc;n's land,
Front against front, I burst upon the brood
Of Thrace and broke their targes, and subdued
Their power to thine. The grace whereof, not small,
Thou hast spurned, and when thy kinsmen, drowning, call,
Comest too late. Thou! Others there have been
These long years, not by nature of our kin . . .
Some under yon rough barrows thou canst see
Lie buried; they were true to Troy and me;
And others, yet here in the shielded line
Or mid the chariots, parching in the shine
Of noonday, starving in the winds that bite
Through Ilion's winter, still endure and fight
On at my side. 'Twas not their way, to lie
On a soft couch and, while the cups go by,
Pledge my good health, like thee, in Thracian wine.
    I speak as a free man. With thee and thine
Hector is wroth, and tells thee to thy face.

<pre>
Thy way is mine, friend. Straight I run my race
In word and deed, and bear no double tongue.
    I tell thee, more than thine my heart was wrung,
Yea, angered past all durance, thus to stay
Back from thy battles. 'Twas a folk that lay
Hard on my borders, Scythians of the north;
Just when my host for Troy had started forth,
They fell upon our homes. I had reached the coast
Of the Friendless Sea and purposed to have crossed
My Thracians there. We turned; and all that plain
Is trampled in a mire of Scythian slain
Ploughed by our spears, and blood of Thrace withal
Not stinted. This it was that drowned thy call
For help and held me back from Ilion's need.
I broke their power; the princes of their breed
I took to hostage, made their elders swear
To bring my house due tribute, year by year,
Then, never lagging, crossed the Pontus mouth,
Marched by long stages through Bithynia south
And here am come . . . not drunken with the feast,
As thou wouldst have me be, not lulled to rest
In golden chambers. In this harness hard
I have borne my nights of winter storm that starred
The Euxine into ice and scared the strong
Paionians.
                  Long I have been, but not too long
To save thee yet. Friend, this is the tenth year
Thou labourest on unceasing, with no clear
Vantage; day creeps by day, and Ares throws
The same red dice for thee and for thy foes.
Now, hear my vow. Before one day's eclipse
I swear to break their wall, to burn their ships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vv. 449-473]</a>
</span>And slay their princes. On the second day
I leave this soil and take my homeward way,
Thy pains relieved. No Trojan of the land
Need move, nor turn the buckler in his hand.
Alone my late-comers will turn the tide
And smite your Greeks, for all their bitter pride.

       Where sleeps your king beneath his shield,

             But our own misery.

</span>Of evil. For to die in soldier's wise,
Since die we needs must . . . though the man who dies
Hath pain . . . to all his house 'tis praise and pride;
But we, like laggards and like fools we died!
    When Hector's hand had showed us where to rest
And told the watchword, down we lay, oppressed
With weariness of that long march, and slept
Just as we fell. No further watch was kept,
Our arms not laid beside us; by the horse
No yoke nor harness ordered. Hector's force
Had victory, so my master heard, and lay
Secure, just waiting for the dawn of day
To attack. So thought we all, and our lines broke
And slept. After a little time I woke,
Thinking about my horses, that the morn
Must see them yoked for war. I found the corn
And gave them plenteously. Then in the deep
Shadow I saw two men who seemed to creep
Close by our line, but swiftly, as I stirred,
Crouched and were seeking to make off unheard.
I shouted then, and bade them keep away:
Two thieves, I thought, from the great host that lay
Round us. They never answered, and, for me,
I said no more but turned and presently
Was sleeping. In my sleep there came a dream.
I seemed to see the horses&mdash;mine own team
I had trained long since and drove at Rhesus' side&mdash;
But wolves were on their backs, wolves, couched astride,
Who drove and scourged; I saw the horses rear
And stagger with wide nostrils, stiff with fear,
And, starting up to drive the beasts away,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vv. 788-809]</a>
</span>I woke.&mdash;A terror of great darkness lay
About me, but I lifted up my head
And listened. There was moaning, like the dead
That moan at night, and over me there flowed,
So soft, so warm&mdash;it was my master's blood,
Who writhed beside me, dying! With a bound
I sprang up, empty-handed, groping round
For spear or sword, when, lo, a young strong man
Was close to me and slashed, and the sword ran
Deep through my flank. I felt its passage well,
So deep, so wide, so spreading . . . then I fell.
And they, they got the bridles in their hand
And fled. . . . Ah! Ah! This pain. I cannot stand.

Provoked to meet in bitter strife of song

I stood again upon thy Father's shore

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> play presupposes a knowledge of the Iliad in
some form, if not exactly in the form which it now
wears. We are not only supposed to know that
Hector, son of Priam, leads the Trojans and their
allies ("Trojans, and Lycians, and Dardans bold":
in tragedy they are also called Phrygians) in defence
against the Greeks&mdash;Argives, Achaeans, Hell&ecirc;nes&mdash;under
Agamemnon, king of men, and his brother
Menela&uuml;s, husband of Helen. This sort of supposition
is usual in all Greek tragedy. It merely
means that the poet takes for granted the main outlines
of the heroic saga. But in this play we are also
supposed to take up the story as it stands at the
opening of the Doloneia or Tenth Book of the Iliad.
Indeed one might almost say that the <i>Rhesus</i> is
simply the Doloneia turned into drama and set in
the Trojan camp. The only other play that is taken
straight from Homer is the Satyr-play, <i>Cyclops</i>, which
tells the story of Odyssey IX., but it is likely enough
that if we possessed more of the earlier epic literature
we should find many other plays closely hugging
their traditional sources.&mdash;The Trojans are camping
out on the field of battle, close to the Greek lines.
Hector, always ready for danger, seems to have his
tent or log-hut set up quite in the van, just behind
the outposts. In Il. X. 415 ff. he is holding counsel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>with the other chieftains "away from the throng";
the allies are taking their sleep and trusting to the
Trojans, who keep awake in groups round the camp
fires; no watchword is mentioned.</p>

<p>P. 5, l. 30, The priest.]&mdash;He would be needed
to make the sacrifice before battle.</p>

<p>P. 5, l. 36, The lash of trembling Pan.]&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a
panic.</p>

<p>P. 5, l. 41, Great beacons in the Argive line.]&mdash;In
the Iliad it is the Trojan watch-fires that are
specially mentioned, especially VIII. 553-end. There
is no great disturbance in the Greek camp in the
Doloneia; there is a gathering of the principal chiefs,
a visit to the Guards, and the despatch of the two
spies, but no general tumult such as there is in
Book II. One cannot help wondering whether our
playwright found in his version of the Doloneia a
description of fires in the Greek camp, such as our
Eighth Book has of those in the Trojan camp. The
object might be merely protection against a night
attack, or it might be a wish to fly, as Hector thinks.
If so, presumably the Assembly changed its mind&mdash;much
as it does in our Book II.&mdash;and determined to
send spies.</p>

<p>P. 5, l. 43 ff., The shipyard timbers.]&mdash;The
Greeks had their ships drawn up on the beach and
protected by some sort of wooden "shipyard"; then
came the camp; then, outside the whole, a trench
and a wall. The fires were in the camp.</p>

<p>P. 8, l. 105, Brother! I would thy wit were like
thy spear!]&mdash;In Homer Hector is impulsive and over-daring,
but still good in counsel. On the stage every
quality that is characteristic is apt to be over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>emphasized,
all that is not characteristic neglected.
Hence on the Attic stage Odysseus is more crafty,
Ajax and Diomedes more blunt, Menelaus more
unwarlike and more uxorious than in Homer.</p>

<p>This speech of Aeneas, though not inapposite, is
rather didactic&mdash;a fault which always remained a
danger to Euripides.</p>

<p>P. 10, l. 150 ff., Dolon.]&mdash;The name is derived from
<i>dolos</i>, "craft." In our version of Homer Dolon
merely wears, over his tunic, the skin of a grey wolf.
He has a leather cap and a bow. In the play he goes,
as Red Indian spies used to go, actually disguised as
a wolf, on all fours in a complete wolf-skin. The
same version is found on the Munich cylix of the
early vase-painter Euphronius (about 500 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), in
which Dolon wears a tight-fitting hairy skin with
a long tail. The plan can of course only succeed in
a country where wild animals are common enough
to be thought unimportant. The playwright has
evidently chosen a more primitive and romantic
version of the story; the Homeric reviser has, as
usual, cut out what might seem ridiculous. (See
J. A. K. Thomson in <i>Classical Review</i>, xxv. pp. 238 f.)</p>

<p>P. 12, l. 175, Ajax, &Icirc;leus' son.]&mdash;"Ajax" is mentioned
here and at ll. 463, 497, 601, as apparently
next in importance to the two Atreidae or to Achilles.
That is natural, but it is a shock to have him here described
as son of Ileus. In the Iliad we should have
had "Ajax son of Telamon." The son of Ileus is
"Ajax the less," a hero of the second rank. Scholars
have conjectured on other grounds that in some older
form of the Iliad-saga Ajax son of Ileus was of much
greater importance. The father "Telamon" and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>connection with Aegina are neither of them original
in the myth.</p>

<p>P. 12, l. 182, Achilles' horses.]&mdash;They are as
glorious in the Iliad as they are here. Cf. especially
the passages where they bear Automedon out of the
battle (end of XVI.), and where Xanthos is given a
human voice to warn his master of the coming of
death (end of XIX.). The heroic age of Greece delighted
in horses. Cf. those of Aeneas, Diomedes,
Eum&ecirc;lus, and Rhesus himself.</p>

<p>P. 15, ll. 225-263, Chorus.]&mdash;Apollo is appealed to
as a God of Thymbra in the Troad, of Delos the
Ionian island, and of Lycia in the South of Asia
Minor; the god of Asiatics and <i>barbaroi</i>, the enemy
of the Achaeans. This is also to a great extent the
conception of Apollo in the Iliad, where he fights
for Troy and is Hector's special patron. The sudden
ferocity towards Helen in the last strophe is quite in
the manner of Euripides; cf. <i>Trojan Women</i>, 1107
ff. (p. 65), 766 ff. (p. 49), and often; also <i>Iph. Taur.</i>
438 ff. (p. 21), where her name comes somewhat as
a surprise.</p>

<p>The stage directions here are of course conjectural:
it does not seem likely that the playwright, having
made Dolon describe his wolf's disguise in detail,
would waste the opportunity of making him crawl off
in it. Cf. on l. 594, p. 63, and at the end of the play.</p>

<p>P. 16, l. 267. Hector is as bluff and hasty here as he
is impulsively obstinate in l. 319 ff., p. 19, impulsively
frank to Rhesus in l. 393 ff., p. 23, and splendidly
courteous under the gibes of the wounded charioteer,
l. 856 ff., p. 47. A fine stage character, if not a very
subtle study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>P. 17, l. 284 ff. The description of the march of the
mountaineers, the vast crowd, the noise, the mixture
of all arms, suggests personal observation. A great
many fifth-century Athenians had probably served
some time or other in Thrace.</p>

<p>P. 20, l. 342, Adrasteia.]&mdash;She-from-whom-there-is-no-Running,
is a goddess identified with Nemesis, a
requiter of sin, especially the sin of pride or overconfidence.
In spite of the opening apology this
whole chorus, with its boundless exultation, is an
offence against her.&mdash;It is interesting to notice that a
town and a whole district in the north of the Troad
was called by her name; the poet is using local colour
in making his Trojans here, and Rhesus in l. 468,
speak of her. There seems also to be something
characteristically Thracian in the story of the Muse
and the River, in the title "Zeus of the Dawn"
given to Rhesus, in the revelry to be held when Ilion
is free, and in the conception of the king in his
dazzling chariot, Sun-god-like.</p>

<p>P. 23, ll. 394-453, Speeches of Hector and Rhesus.]&mdash;The
scene reads to me like a rather crude and
early form of the celebrated psychological controversies
of Euripides. It is simple, but spirited and in character.
The description of Thracian fighting again
suggests personal knowledge, and so does the boasting.
The Thracians apparently bound themselves with
heroic boasts before battle much as Irish and Highland
chieftains sometimes did, or as the Franks did with
their <i>gabs</i>. (See, <i>e.g., Le P&egrave;lerinage de Charlemagne</i>,
as described in Gaston Paris, <i>Litt. du Moyen Age</i>, I.
p. 122 ff.) It was a disgrace if you did not fulfil your
<i>gab</i> afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>Rhesus's defence is apparently true, though in a
modern play one would have expected some explanation
of the rather different story that his mother tells,
l. 933 ff., p. 51. Perhaps he did not realise how she
was holding him back. In any case ancient technique
prefers to leave such details unsettled: cf., for instance,
Helen's speech in the <i>Trojan Women</i>, in which the
false is evidently mixed up with the true, and they
are never separated afterwards.</p>

<p>P. 25, ll. 454 ff. This little Chorus seems to
represent&mdash;in due tragic convention&mdash;an irrepressible
outburst of applause from the Trojans, interrupting
Rhesus's speech. In spite of the words about possible
"wrath" that may follow the Thracian's boasting,
the applause excites him at once to a yet bolder <i>gab</i>.</p>

<p>P. 26, l. 480. It may be remarked that the play
here uses a fairly common Homeric phrase in a
sense which the scholars of our tradition knew but
rejected.</p>

<p>P. 27, l. 501 ff. These three achievements of
Odysseus are all in the traditional saga. The Rapt of
the Palladium, or figure of Pallas, by Odysseus and
Diomedes, was in an old lost epic, called The Little
Iliad; the Begging in Troy in the Little Iliad and
also in Odyssey IV. 242 ff.; the great ambuscades in
Odyssey IV. 290 ff., VIII. 493 ff., and in Odysseus's
own feigned story, XIV. 468 ff. According to our
tradition they belong to a later period of the war than
the death of Rhesus, but perhaps the sequence was
different, or not so definite, at the time of this play.</p>

<p>P. 28, l. 528. Rhesus shows the simple courage of
a barbarian in his contempt for the ruses of Odysseus,
the brutality of a barbarian in the methods of punish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>ment
he proposes. Such proposals would disgust a
Greek; it looks as if they displeased Hector. In any
case his abruptness here, and his careful indication of
the place where the Thracians are to sleep, far from
the rest of the camp, have some dramatic value for
the sequel.</p>

<p>Pp. 28-30, ll. 527-564, Stars and Nightingale
chorus.]&mdash;The beauty of these lines in the Greek is
quite magical, but the stage management of the scene is
difficult. Apparently Hector (l. 523) bids the Guards
come forward from where they are and wait nearer
the front for Dolon; obeying this they come up from
the orchestra, we may suppose, to the stage. Then
watching somewhere near Hector's tent they partly
express, in the usual song, the lyrical emotion of the
night, partly they chat about Dolon and the order
of the watches. The scene is technically very interesting
with its rather abrupt introduction of realism
into the high convention of tragedy. Meantime the
Trojans' time of watch is over and the Lycians, who
ought to watch next, have not come. In a modern
army it would of course be the duty of the new watch
to come and relieve the old; in an ancient barbaric
army&mdash;characteristically&mdash;the old watch had to go
and wake the new. You could not, one must suppose,
trust them to take their turn otherwise. At the end
of the first strophe a Guard suggests that they should
rouse the Lycians; at the end of the second the
Leader definitely gives the word to do so. The
Guards go, and so the stage (and orchestra) is left
empty.</p>

<p>This is plain enough; but why were the Guards
brought away from their original position&mdash;from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>orchestra to the stage? Probably to allow the Greek
spies to pass on towards the Thracian camp by a
different and unoccupied way, not by the way which
the Guards had just taken.</p>

<p>The story of the Nightingale is well known: she
was Philom&ecirc;la, or in the older story Procn&ecirc;, an
Athenian princess, wedded to the faithless Thracian
king, T&ecirc;reus. In a fury of vengeance on her husband
she slew their only son, Itys or Itylus, and now laments
him broken-hearted for ever.</p>

<p>P. 31, l. 567 ff., Odysseus and Diomedes.]&mdash;Observe
how we are left gradually to discover that they have
met and killed Dolon. They enter carrying, as far
as we can make out, a wolf-skin that looks like his:
they had evidently spoken to him, ll. 572, 575: it <i>is</i>
his and they have killed him&mdash;l. 592 f.</p>

<p>All the Odysseus-Diomedes scenes have something
unusual about them, something daring, turbulent, and
perhaps lacking in dramatic tact. The silent rush on
Hector's empty tent is hard to parallel. The cruel
Athena is Euripidean; but her appearance in the
midst of the action is startling, though it may be paralleled
from Sophocles' Ajax. In Euripides Gods are
generally kept for the prologue or epilogue, away from
the ordinary action. (The vision of Iris and Lyssa in
the middle of the Heracles has at least the stage clear
of mortals and the Chorus apparently in a kind of
dream.) Again the conception of Athena pretending
to be Cypris is curious. The disguised Athena is
common in the Odyssey, but she does not disguise
herself as another goddess. (It is sometimes held that
this scene requires four actors, which would be a
decisive mark of lateness; but this is not really so.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>The actor who took Odysseus could easily get round
in time to take Paris also&mdash;especially if he made his
exit at l. 626, before Athena sees Paris. And the
Greek stage had no objection to such doubling.)
Lastly, the scene of turmoil between the spies and the
Guards is extraordinary in a tragedy, though it would
suit well in a pro-satyric play. See Introduction.</p>

<p>P. 33, l. 594, Stage direction.]&mdash;They bear Dolon's
"spoils" or "tokens": probably his wolf-skin. If
they bring it with them they must probably do something
with it, and to hang it where it may give
Hector a violent start seems the natural proceeding.
Also, they can hardly be carrying it in the scene with
the Guards, l. 675 ff., p. 38 f. That would be madness.
They must have got rid of it before then, and
this seems the obvious place for doing so.</p>

<p>P. 36, ll. 637 ff., Athena as Cypris.]&mdash;It is not
clear how this would be represented on the Greek
stage, though there is no reason to think there would
be any special difficulty. On a modern stage it could
be worked as follows:&mdash;The Goddess will be behind
a gauze, so that she is invisible when only the lights
in front of the gauze are lit, but visible when a light
goes up behind it. She will first appear with helmet
and spear in some hard light; then disappear and be
rediscovered in the same place in a softer light, the
helmet and spear gone and some emblems of Cypris&mdash;say
a flower and a dove&mdash;in their place. Of course
the voice will change too.</p>

<p>The next scene, where the two spies are caught
and let go, is clear enough in its general structure;
the details must remain conjectural.</p>

<p>P. 40, l. 703, What the High God.]&mdash;It would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>unparalleled in classical Greek to describe a man by
his religion; but this phrase seems only to mean:
"What is his tribal God?" <i>i.e.</i> what is his tribe?
Thus it could be said of Isagoras in Herodotus (v. 66)
that his kinsmen sacrificed to Carian Zeus, suggesting,
presumably, that he had Carian blood.</p>

<p>P. 42, l. 728, Voice of the wounded man outside.]&mdash;The
puzzled and discouraged talk of the
Guards round the fire, the groaning in the darkness
without, the quick alarm among the men who had
been careless before, and the slow realisation of
disaster that follows&mdash;all these seem to me to be
wonderfully indicated, though the severe poetic convention
excludes any approach to what we, by modern
prose standards, would call effective realism.</p>

<p>P. 44, ll. 756-803. This fine vivid speech has
something of the famous Euripidean Messenger-Speeches
in it; though they are apt to be much
longer and also are practically never spoken by a
principal in the action, always by a subordinate or an
onlooker. Cf. the speech of the Messenger-Shepherd
above, p. 17 f. An extreme sharpness of articulation is
characteristic of Euripides' later work: each speech,
each scene, each effect is isolated and made complete
in itself. The Messenger prepares his message, relates
his message and goes, not mixing himself up in the
further fortunes of the drama. But this extreme
pursuit of lucidity and clear outlines is not nearly so
marked in the early plays: in the <i>Cyclops</i> the
Messenger's speech is actually spoken by Odysseus,
ll. 382-436, and the Serving Man and Serving Maid
in the <i>Alcestis</i> are not mere abstract Messengers.</p>

<p>P. 46, ll. 810-830, Hector and the Guard.]&mdash;There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>is intentional colour here&mdash;the impulsive half-barbaric
rage of Hector, the oriental grovelling of the Guard,
and of course the quick return to courteous self-mastery
with which Hector receives the taunts of the
wounded man.</p>

<p>P. 46, l. 819. The Guard seems to think that the
spies got past him when he came to Hector's tent
at the beginning of the play. It was really later,
when he made his men leave their post to wake the
Lycians. Perhaps he is lying.</p>

<p>P. 48, l. 876, Justice knows.]&mdash;It is a clever touch
to leave the Thracian still only half-convinced and
grumbling.</p>

<p>P. 49, l. 882, Appearance of the Muse.]&mdash;A beautiful
scene. It has been thought to come abruptly and,
as it were, unskilfully on top of the familiar dialogue
between Hector and the Thracian. But the movements,
first of soldiers lifting and carrying the wounded
man, and then of messengers taking word to Priam for
burial of the men slain, make the transition much
easier.</p>

<p>P. 50, l. 895 ff. and l. 906 ff., A dirge of the Thracian
mountains.]&mdash;Such dirges must have struck the Greeks
as the fragments of Ossian struck the Lowlanders
among us. I have found that the dirge here goes
naturally into a sort of Ossianic rhythm.</p>

<p>P. 51, l. 915. The speech of the Muse seems like
the writing of a poet who is, for the moment, tired
of mere drama, and wishes to get back into his own
element. Such passages are characteristic of Euripides.&mdash;The
death of Rhesus seems to the Muse like
an act of vengeance from the dead Thamyris, the
Thracian bard who had blasphemed the Muses and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>challenged them to a contest of song. They conquered
him and left him blind, but still a poet. The
story in Homer is more terrible, though more civilised:
"They in wrath made him a maimed man, they took
away his heavenly song and made him forget his
harping."</p>

<p>Thamyris, the bard who defied Heaven; Orpheus,
the bard, saint, lover, whose severed head still cried
for his lost Eurydice; Musaeus, the bard of mystic
wisdom and initiations&mdash;are the three great legendary
figures of this Northern mountain minstrelsy.</p>

<p>P. 52, l. 950. These short speeches between Hector
and the Leader of the Guard make a jarring note in
the midst of the Muse's lament. Perhaps it would
not be so if we knew how the play was produced,
but at present this seems like one of several marks
of comparative crudity in technique which mark the
play, amid all its daring and inventiveness.</p>

<p>P. 52, l. 962 ff., My son shall not be laid in any
grave.]&mdash;Like other Northern barbaric princes, such as
Orpheus (l. 972 below) and Zalmoxis (Herodotus, iv.
95) and Holgar the Dane, Rhesus lies in a hidden
chamber beneath the earth, watching, apparently, for
the day of uttermost need when he must rise to help
his people. There is no other passage in Greek tragedy
where such a fate is attributed to a hero, though the
position of Darius in the <i>Persae</i> and Agamemnon
in the <i>Choephori</i> or the <i>Electra</i> is in some ways
analogous.</p>

<p>The last lines of the Muse have a very Euripidean
ring: cf. <i>Medea</i>, l. 1090 (p. 61, "My thoughts have
roamed a cloudy land"), <i>Alcestis</i>, l. 882.</p>

<p>P. 54, ll. 983-end. This curious and moving end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>&mdash;not
in death or peace but in a girding of tired men
to greater toil&mdash;reminds one of the last words of <i>The
Trojan Women</i>: "Forth to the long Greek ships
And the sea's foaming," and the last words of the
<i>Chanson de Roland</i> there quoted.</p>

<p>The Trojans evidently go forth under the shadow
of disaster, though with firmness and courage. The
stage direction is of course purely conjectural. If
Diomedes left some sign of Dolon's death for Hector
to see, as he probably must have done, then Hector
must at some time or other see it. If so, this seems
to be the place.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
